# Think&Learn
---
> We brings you the series of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Services embedded in a Web App, which will help children in learning new concepts with a unique approach.
> Our Project named as “THINK & LEARN” will be a learning mate for children (especially of age groups, 5-16 years). Many of us know that in the time of this pandemic, online learning is proven a havoc for children. They want to explore the things, but can’t! Because no one is there to tell them what they saw and what they read. 
Our app contains a friendly bot which will help kids to understand the scientific terms, they usually encounter while study. Now, they don’t need to bang their heads in dictionaries or google it for multiple answers. They can conversate with their bots as a friend and get the answers to their queries.
Our app also contains a Scanner, if any time a kid sees an animal or a flower, and want to know about it, they can use scanner to identify the animal/flower and can gain insights of that animal or flower. On the backend, our app is using image classification machine learning models to predict and classify the image.
The UI of the project is made very comfortable and simple by keeping it in mind that, it is made for small children.

## Know About Technology used: 
- TensorFlow to train Image Classification models, also uses TensorFlow JS to embed it in the web app.
- Azure Chat Bot services is used to train and deploy the Chatbot in the web app.
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS is used to design the frontend of the web app. 
-	Azure Web App Service is used to host our project.
- GitHub is used to store the source files and provides continuous integration with Azure Static Apps (preview)
